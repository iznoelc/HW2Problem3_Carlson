## User Registration Validation System
A Java application that demonstrates the implementation of chain of responsibility (COR) pattern. Allows for the simulation of a user registration system, where a user is notified when their inputs are valid or invalid, determining whether they can 'register' for an application.

### Design Patterns Implemented
#### 1. COR
COR pattern was used in order to pass the request of user validation along a chain of validators, ensuring username, password, email, and phone number input by the user are all valid according to the validator's requirements.

### Resources Used
- COR slides
- JavaSwing code provided on Canvas
